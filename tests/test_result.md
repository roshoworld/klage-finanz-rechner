Debtor fields prioritized when they contain meaningful data. Email fields only required when they are the primary source of case data. Enhanced logic checks for meaningful data first before determining validation requirements. 'Unbekannt' value validation working correctly. Either/OR validation logic properly implemented. Issue #2 RESOLVED - Form Data Persistence: Complete form data persistence implemented with get_form_data() method. All form fields retain values after validation failures using $form_data array with proper escaping (esc_attr, esc_textarea). Found 12 persistent form fields including case_id, debtor information, and email evidence fields. Users no longer lose entered data on validation errors.
